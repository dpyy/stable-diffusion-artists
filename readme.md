# Description

This repo contains a curated list of artists whose names can be added to Stable Diffusion prompts to change the art style. Images are provided to give a rough idea of how Stable Diffusion interprets their style.

Most of the artists listed here are either modern digital artists or have a style that I think is cool.

All images are generated with model 1.4 and the following parameters:

Prompt: \<artist name> art
Seed: 0
Size: 512x512
CSG: 7.5
Sampling Steps: 30
Sampler: k_lms

# Contributing

If there is an artist that the model knows about that you think should be on this list, you can open an issue or pull request. Keep in mind that Stable Diffusion does not know every single artist.

Modern artists are prefered.

# Artists

Artists are grouped by which kinds of images their style can be applied to.

## Anything

These artists' names can be attached to any prompt. While they may be know for specific subject matter, their styles are very distinct and can apply to anything.

## Mainly Characters

These artists' names can be attached to any prompt, but they are mainly known for characters. Anime artists go here.

## Characters Only

These artists' names can only be applied to character prompts. Attaching their names to a non-character prompt will create a character anyway.

#### <details><summary>Agnes Cecile</summary>![](images/agnes_cecile.jpg)</details>

#### <details><summary>Alphonse Mucha (Mild NSFW)</summary>![](images/alphonse_mucha.jpg)</details>

#### <details><summary>Audrey Kawasaki</summary>![](images/audrey_kawasaki.jpg)</details>

#### <details><summary>Conrad Roset</summary>![](images/conrad_roset.jpg)</details>

#### <details><summary>Tom Bagshaw</summary>![](images/tom_bagshaw.jpg)</details>

## No Characters

These artists' names go well in prompts for just about everything except characters. They make great landscapes or architechture images.

#### <details><summary>Ed Mell</summary>![](images/ed_mell.jpg)</details>

#### <details><summary>Hubert Robert</summary>![](images/hubert_robert.jpg)</details>

#### <details><summary>Raphael Lacoste</summary>![](images/raphael_lacoste.jpg)</details>

## Corruption

These artists are known for horrific sci-fi/fantasy, and their styles will corrupt everything they touch.

#### <details><summary>H.R. Giger</summary>![](images/hr_giger.jpg)</details>

#### <details><summary>Wayne Barlowe</summary>![](images/wayne_barlowe.jpg)</details>
